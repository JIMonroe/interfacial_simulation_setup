# Best practices and checklist for the set-up and molecular dynamics simulation of solid-fluid interfacial systems

Jacob Monroe, Andrew Summers, Kristen Fichthorn

## A brief introduction to interfacial science

### Brief overview of molecular interactions in the context of interfaces
* Electrostatic interactions
  * Considerations at short range
  * Considerations at long range
    * Distinct from short range if have something like a net dipole moment in the surface or a double-layer at the surface, or longer range surface-surface interactions
* Dispersion interactions
  * Considerations at short range
  * Considerations at long range 
    * Again distinct from short-range, with potentials such as an effective 9-3, etc.
* Adsorption at interfaces
* Surface reactivity and covalent bonding

### Brief overview of thermodynamics of interfaces
* Introduction of thermodynamic ensembles involving surface area, surface tension, and interfacial free energy
* Definition of an interface 
* Interfacial tension and interfacial free energy - not the same for solid interfaces
* General resources  
  “Molecular Theory of Capillarity,” Rowlinson and Widom  
  “Intermolecular and Surface Forces,” Israelachvili

### Commonly used terminology and abbreviations
 * It was decided that every document should have such a section, which is likely a very good idea

### Background on specific interfaces of interest/case studies
* Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
  * May be of general interest, not sure
* Metallic Interfaces
  * If there are any specific background
